# Plan for SONAR-netCDF4 convention adherence work in 0.6.0

Disruptive changes are preced by the prefixed **(D)**

- **(D)** `Beam` subgroup(s). echopype's move of `Beam` subgroup to a top-level group. Move it back into `Sonar`, as `Sonar/Beams` (or a slightly different name?)
- **(D)** Add a `beam` dimension to `Beam` group
  - For single beam or split-beam, it could be a length-1 explicit dimension or an implicit coordinate (scalar `beam` )
  - For multi-beam, an explicit dimension is required. Currently the EK80 parser generates such a structure, but the dimension is named `quadrant` (WJ: there is an extra dimension quadrant â€” you can call them separate beams, but since Simrad use quadrant i used that for our first shot though I think it should be probably sector since it is not always 4)
  - EM: It occurs to me now that, in terms of match-up with SONAR-netCDF4, the Beam group in AZFP and EK60 echopype nc/zarr files could be described as having an implicit, single-value `beam` dimension. Single-value dimensions can be implemented interchangeably in a netcdf file either explicitly with the dimension or implicitly (refer to the CF convention). In SONAR-netCDF4, since there is an explicit `beam` dimension, single-beam data would be expected to be stored with beam as a dimension.
  - issue of convention use of "beam" dimension (ie, >1 beams per Beam subgroup? Based on "beam mode" alone?)
- `range_bin` issues
  - `range_bin` is not in the convention, but it's central to the echopype data structure
  - [Currently this coordinate variables doesn't have attributes.](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/373) Add units, long name, etc
  - small TODO, WJ's "convention vlen" comments. See also [this discussion in the SONAR-netCDF4 github repo](https://github.com/ices-publications/SONAR-netCDF4/issues/28) that directly addresses that aspect of the convention, and potential problems with it
- **(D)** Rename `time` dimensions and coordinates in `Platform` group, to adhere to the convention naming guideline. `location_time` does not comply; it should be `time1`, `time2`, etc
- Restart the element-by-element compliance check tables
- **Fix current errors/issues with EK60**
  - `Sonar/sonar_serial_number` is empty. See [issue 212](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/212)
  - Populate `Sonar/sonar_software_name`. Right now it's left blank; see [convert/set_groups_ek60.py#L89](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/blob/class-redesign/echopype/convert/set_groups_ek60.py#L89) and [issue 210 comment](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/210#issuecomment-822642399)
  - `Sonar/sonar_model attribute` entry is "ER60". It should be EK60. Currently EK60 `Sonar/sonar_model` is set in [convert/set_groups_ek60.py#L87](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/blob/class-redesign/echopype/convert/set_groups_ek60.py#L87) as `self.parser_obj.config_datagram['sounder_name']`, so that looks fine, unless the datagram `sounder_name` is parsed incorrectly. See [issue 210 comment](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/210#issuecomment-821761942)
  - `Provenance > src_filenames` should be a list of strings per the convention, but currently it's a string. It's also mispelled, as it should be `source_filenames`
- **Reassess AZFP compliance, and primary issues**
  - There are many first-order issues!
  - Some of the comments under EK60 also apply to AZFP
- **Improved global attributes**
  - `survey_name` top-level attribute is not in the convention
  - When an attribute is empty (specially global attributes), should it still occur but with a blank value, or be ommitted altogether? Current implementation is inconsistent
  - Add missing core CF attributes (feature_type, cdm, etc), where appropriate
  - Add some useful attributes from ACDD, specially ones involving spatial and temporay bounding boxes; roles; etc; in top-level group? Will improve discoverability.
  - See AcMeta to see if we can define an initial subset of it that ideally follows the ACDD attributes we'd be interested in
- **Go over other relevant discussions and notes, to see if I'm missing anything**
  - Google Drive files (mappings, sample nc files, etc) under [echopype/convention_check](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1MPBRzrehXk9qAt8ZuBjFzR2Xh-0WFXXU)
  - [Document and verify compliance with SONAR-netCDF4 convention #210](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/210)
  - echopype documentation: [Data format](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data-format.html) and [Why echopype?](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/why.html)
  - `conventions/SONAR-netCDF4_compliance.ipynb`: code and file instrospection, and comments I've added there
  - I think I've already captured notes from these sources:
    - `sonar-conventions` Slack channel in `uw-echospace` workspace. Going back to the start of the channel in April '21
    - My hand written notes on the SONAR-netCDF4 report
